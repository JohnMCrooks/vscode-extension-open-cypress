WIP: Allows you to open cypress specs

https://github.com/tnrich/vscode-extension-open-cypress

# Usage
In a spec file open the cmd palette (cmd+p) and type "Run Cypress"

# Todo: 
Eventually I'd like this extension to be able to 
- not just open but also be able to AUTOMATICALLY run a spec file (requires cypress team to add a way to make all specs run upon open or a single spec run on open)
- add a .only to the it() block that the cursor is in (alternatively cypress team should add a way to grep to run a single it block IMO)
